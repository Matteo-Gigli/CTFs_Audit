Valve Exercise Request

The evil Dr. N. Gas has put into orbit a machine that can suck all the air out of the atmosphere.
You sneaked into his spaceship and must find a nozzle to open the main valve and stop the machine!
Assert the situation and don't panic. Hint: on the valve is marked "model no. EIP-150"
