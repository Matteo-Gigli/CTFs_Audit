Golden Ticket Exercise Request

The organizers of Ekoparty decided that the tickets for the 2023 conference would be purchased through a
smart contract.
However, the conference is oversold and you have to sign up for a waitlist to get your ticket.
The problem is that they put you on hold for ten years and the only option you have is to extend the wait.
After the wait is over, you have to enter a raffle to see if you get the ticket
